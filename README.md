# vim-colors-japanesque

The colorscheme featuring Japanese traditional colors.

This is forked from [aereal/vim-colors-japanesque](https://github.com/aereal/vim-colors-japanesque).

## Difference

The following features are defferent from the original colorscheme by aereal.

* Modification of the color pallet. It replaces [鶯 (#6C6A2D)](http://nipponcolors.com/#uguisu) with [群青 (#5CABDC)](http://nipponcolors.com/#gunjyo).
* 24bit True Color CUI support. (I also send a PR of this change to the original repository.)
* Correction of highlighting `Conceal`. (Same as above)
